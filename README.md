Customer Segmentation Prediction App
This is a Flask web application that predicts customer segments using a KMeans clustering model. Users can enter feature values to get predictions and view a customer segmentation plot.

Live Demo
Check out the live app here.

Features
User Input Form: Enter features for prediction.
Prediction Display: View the predicted customer segment.
Segmentation Plot: Visual representation of customer segmentation.
Technologies Used
Flask: Web framework for building the application.
Flask-WTF: Form handling with validation.
Matplotlib: Plotting and visualization.
Joblib: Model serialization and deserialization.
HTML/CSS: Front-end structure and styling.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation-app.git
cd customer-segmentation-app
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have the saved KMeans model file:

Place the model file (saved_model.pkl) in the root directory of the project.
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to view the app.

How It Works
User Input: Enter feature values (e.g., annual income and spending score) into the form.
Model Prediction: The app uses a pre-trained KMeans clustering model to predict the customer segment.
Display Prediction: The predicted customer segment is displayed on the same page.
Show Plot: A pre-generated plot of customer segmentation is shown below the prediction.
